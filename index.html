                                                     greatest Presidents in American history.</h2>

      <section class="para__container">

        <p>Abraham Lincoln was an American lawyer and statesman who served as the 16th president of
           the United States from 1861 until his assassination in 1865. Lincoln led the nation
           through the American Civil War and succeeded in preserving the Union, abolishing slavery,
           bolstering the federal government, and modernizing the U.S. economy. Lincoln was born
           into poverty in a log cabin in Kentucky and was raised on the frontier, primarily in
           Indiana. He was self-educated and became a lawyer, Whig Party leader, Illinois state
           legislator, and U.S. Congressman from Illinois. In 1849, he returned to his law practice
           but became vexed by the opening of additional lands to slavery as a result of the
           Kansasâ€“Nebraska Act of 1854.</p>

        <p>
          He reentered politics in 1854, becoming a leader in the new Republican Party, and he
          reached a national audience in the 1858 Senate campaign debates against Stephen Douglas
          Lincoln ran for President in 1860, sweeping the North to gain victory. Pro-slavery
          elements in the South viewed his election as a threat to slavery, and Southern states
          began seceding from the Union. During this time the newly formed Confederate States of
          America began seizing federal military bases in the south. Just over one month after
          Lincoln assumed the presidency, the Confederate States attacked Fort Sumter, a U.S. fort
          in South Carolina. Following the bombardment, Lincoln mobilized forces to suppress the
          rebellion and restore the Union.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lincoln, a moderate Republican, had to navigate a contentious array of factions with
          friends and opponents from both the Democratic and Republican parties. His allies, the War
          Democrats and the Radical Republicans, demanded harsh treatment of the Southern
          Confederates. Anti-war Democrats (called "Copperheads") despised Lincoln, and
          irreconcilable pro-Confederate elements plotted his assassination. He managed the factions
          by exploiting their mutual enmity, carefully distributing political patronage, and by
          appealing to the American people. His Gettysburg Address came to be seen as one of the
          greatest and most influential statements of American national purpose.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lincoln closely supervised the strategy and tactics in the war effort, including the
          selection of generals, and implemented a naval blockade of the South's trade. He suspended
          habeas corpus in Maryland, and he averted British intervention by defusing the Trent
          Affair. In 1863 he issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared the slaves in the
          states "in rebellion" to be free. It also directed the Army and Navy to "recognize and
          maintain the freedom of such persons" and to receive them "into the armed service of the
          United States." Lincoln also pressured border states to outlaw slavery, and he promoted
          the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which upon its ratification
          abolished slavery.
        </p>

        <p>Lincoln managed his own successful re-election campaign. He sought to heal the war-torn
           nation through reconciliation. On April 14, 1865, just days after the war's end at
           Appomattox, he was attending a play at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C., with his wife
           Mary when he was fatally shot by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth. Abraham
           Lincoln is remembered as a martyr and a national hero for his wartime leadership and for
           his efforts to preserve the Union and abolish slavery. Lincoln is often ranked in both
           popular and scholarly polls as the greatest president in American history.</p>
